    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nThe R ecosystem provides an assortment of options and libraries for implementing caching into one’s data-related workflows, for example:\nmemoise\ncachem\nRcache\ncacher\nstorr\nplus many others.\nHowever, there seems to be a slight lack in support for caching with regard to cloud hosted workflows and web applications.\nTypical Web Application’s Architecture\nAs an example, take a typical web-application architecture where the process is segmented into three separate layers:\n This generalized architecture is deemed the Three-Tier Architecture and is a model generally used by app developers to create flexible and reusable applications.\nBroken down, the three layers are:\nPresentation Layer - the interface the end-user interacts with. Its primary duty is to translate tasks and results from servers into output that the end-user can understand. In short, this tier is the User Interface or client.\nApplication Layer - primary coordinator of the back-end of the application. This tier processes commands, makes logical decisions and processes data between the end user-interface and the back-end database. In short, this tier is the business logic.\nData Layer - simply put, this tier is where data is stored and accessed by the application layer. This tier composes of the various data stores needed by the application to access and retrieve data used in both previously mentioned layers, i.e. databases and cloud storage.\nA benefit of the three-tier architecture is that each layer can work and be maintained, developed, and tested in isolation, independent of the other layers. Therefore every time the application queries for data, the speed is limited by network performance.\nData retrieval time plays a key role in overall user experience (UX) and is a critical requirement for most large applications meant for production.\nDatabase Caching Overview\nCaching is a buffering technique that stores frequently-queried data in a temporary memory. It makes data easier to be accessed and reduces workloads for databases. For example, you need to retrieve a user’s profile from the database and you need to go from a server to server. After the first time, the user profile is stored next (or much nearer) to you. Therefore, it greatly reduces the time to read the profile when you need it again.\nThe cache can be set up in different tiers or on its own, depending on the use case. It works with any type of database including both Relational and NoSQL Databases.\nBenefits of Caching\nPerformance — Performance is improved by making data easier to be accessed through the cache and reduces workloads for database.\nScalability — Workload of back-end query is distributed to the cache system which is lower costs and allow more flexibility in processing of data.\nAvailability — If back-end database server is unavailable, cache can still provide continuous service to the application, making the system more resilient to failures.\nOverall, it is the minimally invasive strategy to improve application performance by implementing caching with additional benefits of scalability and availability.\nThere are many implementations of caching in modern application frameworks including:\nCache Aside\nRead Through\nWrite Through\nWrite Back\nWrite Around\nFor example here is an architectural diagram of the Cache Aside workflow:\n\nOk so now moving onto caching in relation to R:\nCaching in Shiny\nRecently, the shiny package introduced new functions that aid in caching: bindCache and renderCachedPlot.\nrenderCachedPlot() requires shiny version 1.5.0 or higher.\nbindCache() requires shiny version 1.6.0 or higher.\nAdding a Cache Layer Between Application and Database\nRedis is the most commonly used back-end for implementing a caching layer between the application and database in production, and it is pretty awesome.\nOne can easily spin up a local Redis backend using docker as follows:\ndocker run --rm --name redisbank -d -p 6379:6379 redis:5.0.5 --requirepass bebopalula\nThis will run a redis container at localhost exposed to port 6379 (Redis’ typical port).\nNext, you can add a redis cache to your R workflow using a generated R6 object that represents the redis_cache created with the bank package in conjunction with the memoise package as so:\nNote: the redux package will be required to implement the redis_cache R6 object here\nlibrary(bank)\nlibrary(memoise)\n\nredis_cache <- bank::cache_redis$new(password = \"bebopalula\")\n\nf <- function(x) {\n  sample(1:1000, x)\n}\n\nmf <- memoise::memoise(f, cache = redis_cache)\n\nmf(5)\n\nmf(10)\nand inside Shiny:\nui <- fluidPage(\n  # Creating a slider input that will be used as a cache key\n  sliderInput(\"nrow\", \"NROW\", 1, 32, 32),\n  # Plotting a piece of mtcars\n  plotOutput(\"plot\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  output$plot <- renderCachedPlot(\n    {\n      # Pretending this takes a long time\n      Sys.sleep(2)\n      plot(mtcars[1:input$nrow, ])\n    },\n    cacheKeyExpr = list(\n      # Defining the cache key\n      input$nrow\n    ),\n    # Using our redis cache\n    cache = redis_cache\n  )\n}\nshinyApp(ui, server)\nFor a more involved shiny example you could use:\ngenerate_app(redis_cache)\nTry it Out!\n\n\n\n",

I argue that we can apply the same logic to facilitate an environment which provides a natural, orchestrated flow between the various activities we undertake, both online and in the console.\nIn this post I use searching the web, a process developers rely on heavily for many different reasons, as a basic example of an area for improvement.\nI will show you some examples of querying specific search engines directly from your R console as well as provide some pre-configured functions for some of my most common use-cases.\nBefore showcasing the code, first I want to bring to light some ideas surrounding our daily workflows as developers and how we interact with the web.\nYour Mind is a CPU\n\n“The optimal number of threads in any system is one thread.” - Scott Hanselman\n\nThink of your mind as a CPU (central processing unit) like that on your computer. Each separate task you pursue throughout the day relies on a limited amount of resources, which can be thought of as your bank of availableRandom Access Memory, or RAM.\nFrom this perspective, the idea of multi-tasking becomes multi-threading, and as developers we all know that for computers to run asynchronous, parallel, multi-threaded processes requires a highly intricate, well designed, and deeply thought out infrastructure to work properly without overloading the CPU and crashing the machine.\nSimilarly, switching contexts between different digital environments causes your mind to have to continuously re-adjust and reboot its underlying resources in order to facilitate the influx of new information in need of being processed.\nIn other words, it takes time, energy, and resources to get your mind to focus, and every time we switch tasks or contexts, we lose energy that wouldn’t have been lost if we had just stayed in one context initially. The fatigue that builds up from all of this energy loss can potentially demotivate us, as well as cause mental burnout.\nProgrammers should strive to reach a state of flow in which complete focus can be given to one activity.\nThis requires determination and discipline in order to keep that focus streamlined as well as a proper environment which motivates focus instead of scattered, distracted thought.\nThe solution to avoiding burnout and unproductive programming habits is to provide an ecosystem where context switching is minimized and when needed, streamlined.\nSearching from R\nIdentifying an Opportunity\nHave you ever wanted to search google directly from R? What about query your organizations Github repos or search for packages on your respective CRAN mirror?\nThis thought never crossed my mind until I took a second to think about the potential benefits of constructing a system for implementing this in R.\nThe problem I found was two-fold:\nSearching the web for R specific resources can be frustrating, time-consuming, and difficult.\nThe process of switching contexts from R to the browser is unproductive and breaks my natural development flow.\nIdentifying these issues, I took it as an opportunity to create something new, and potentially beneficial to others as we developers love to do.\nReviewing Current Processes\nAlthough most R developers are extensively familiar with The DRY Principle (Don’t repeat yourself) in programming, many do not attempt to extend the principle outside of their code.\nThinking on the principle further, I realized that the amount of time developers interact with the web through a web browser interface is much larger than we may think and is only growing as our dependence on online services and learning resources increase exponentially.\nFor me, the idea of searching from your command prompt or terminal stemmed from my repetitive need to search online for some form of information whilst in the midst of a programming endeavor. While there are many amazing API’s, SDK’s, and localized web-oriented frameworks allowing developers to interact with the web from their console, I found myself in need of a more general, simplistic approach to querying information hosted online from my local machine.\nOnce I stopped to think about my daily processes while developing locally and interacting with the internet, I quickly realized that there is a much larger frequency of instances where I am in need of browsing the web than I originally would have anticipated. Whether navigating to my web browser to google a new concept, review a Github pull request, or even launch a locally hosted shiny application, I found that I use my browsers constantly throughout the day.\nTo name a few examples:\nReviewing a new pull request on Github or searching my backlog of issues assigned to me\nSearching for new software or downloading a new version\nSearching my cloud storage drives for files or data\nSearching my emails for important information\nReviewing online documentation when learning something new\nRetrieving a forgotten API Key or account password\nChecking on and maintaining a hosted cloud service platform\nWatching a demo video on youtube for a new application\nChecking my RSS feeds and developer blogs to stay up to date on current news\nSearching google for a new library, concept, or framework\nAs you can see, there are a variety of instances where interacting with and querying the web has become a routine in our daily development workflows and learning processes.\nAdditionally, due to the lack of a more streamlined, self-contained approach to this reliance on the web while programming, I found myself easily distracted my all of the bells and whistles the internet and my browsers have to offer. Between all of the bookmarks, feeds, notifications and variety of browser extensions the simple process of leaving your code and opening your browser has much larger implications than most people realize.\nWhile this may seem like a minimal interruption to your programming workflow, the fact of the matter is that programming is a form of work which requires a very deep, specific environment and mindset in order to keep your development pipelines productive and efficient. In other words, programming is not easy and requires intense focus.\nTherefore, developers should do everything they can to avoid having to switch in and out of the various shallow contexts surrounding our everyday lives while attempting to perform a session of productive coding.\nDeveloping a Solution\nBrowser Search Engines\nTo provide a simple, yet powerful solution to the issues surrounding browsing the internet for necessary resources, I started with my personal browser settings.\nMost web browser providers facilitate a setting where you can configure your own custom configurations for creating search queries to specific web sites using your address bar.\nFor example, in Chrome if you navigate to Settings > Manage Search Engines you will see a list of default search engine providers such as google, bing, and yahoo as well as some auto-generated engines created by websites you have visited in the past such as Youtube or Medium.\nWhat most people do not realize is they can add add their own search engines and keywords also.\nFor example, if I want to search Github repositories querying with a specific keyword while filtering for only repositories categorized with the language R the query URL would be: https://github.com/search?q=%slanguage%3Ar.\nYou can produce this yourself by searching from Github and applying the filters yourself and replacing the term you searched for with %s, similar to the sprintf context. Lastly, assign a keyword of ghr and test it out by typing ghr in your address bar and pressing tab or enter. Now when you search it will direct you to Github R repositories!\nExample: Search Github for tidyverse with keyword ghr filtering for Language:R:\n\nnote that this is setup with the following in chrome://settings/searchEngines:\n\nBuilding on this framework I setup in my browser years ago, I decided to take it one step further by bringing the searching functionality to my personal R package browsr focusing on R-specific search engines (it can be quite difficult to search effectively for R resources filtering out everything else given R is only one letter).\nSetting up the Search Engines\nFor setting up the search engines all I needed to do was migrate my browser customized search engine URL’s into R by wrapping them in R functions which pass the %s syntax as a function argument.\nHere is a list of the search engines I have implemented so far and their functions:\nGeneral Search Function\nSearch Github\nSearch RSeek.org\nSearch Finzi’s R Site\nSearch the R Forum on Nabble\nSearch Google\nSearch R-Project Domain from Google\nSearch METACRAN\nExamples\nHere is a list of some common examples:\nGmail: https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/#apps/%s\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s&page={startPage?}&utm_source=opensearch\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%s&opensearch=1\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/search?q=%s\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/search?q=%s\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.in/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=%s\nSome may find it useful to create custom github queries for their Github accounts:\nYour personal Github repositories: https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>?tab=repositories&q=%s\nYour organizations Github repositories: https://github.com/search?q=org%3A<GITHUB_ORGANIZATIoN>+%s\nExample Tables\nGeneral\nSearch Engine\nKeyword\nQuery URL\nEdge Settings\nsettings\nedge://settings/?search=%s\nEdge History\nhist\nedge://history/all?q=%s\nGmail Inbox Search\ngmail\nhttps://inbox.google.com/search/%s\nGoogle Drive\ngdrive\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=%s\nGithub\ngh\nhttps://github.com/search?q=%s&ref=opensearch\nGithub Gist\ngist\nhttps://gist.github.com/search?q=&ref=opensearch\nStackOverFlow\nstackoverflow\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%s\nDev.to\ndevto\nhttps://dev.to/search?q=%s\nDevDocs\ndevdocs\nhttps://devdocs.io/#q=%s\nDeveloper Resources\nAnd some more general developer resources:\nSearch Engine\nKeyword\nQuery URL\nGithub\ngh\nhttps://github.com/search?q=%s&ref=opensearch\nGithub Gist\ngist\nhttps://gist.github.com/search?q=&ref=opensearch\nStackOverFlow\nstackoverflow\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%s\nDev.to\ndevto\nhttps://dev.to/search?q=%s\nDevDocs\ndevdocs\nhttps://devdocs.io/#q=%s\nMozilla WebDocs\nmozdocs\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=%s&w=3&qs=plugin\nR-Resources\nThe R-Project Website provides some useful search engines here:\n\n\nTaking these references as a starting point we can create some query URLs for searching R specifically:\nSearch Engine\nKeyword\nQuery URL\nR Site Search by Finzi\nrsite\nhttp://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/namazu.cgi?query=%s&max=100&result=normal&sort=score&idxname=functions&idxname=views\nRSeek\nrseek\nhttps://www.rseek.org/?q=%s\nR Nabble Forum\nrnabble\nhttps://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/template/NamlServlet.jtp?macro=search_page&node=789695&query=%s\nAdvanced Google Search: R Project\nrproj\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=%s&domains=r-project.org&sitesearch=r-project.org&btnG=Google+Search\nAdditional R\nAdditionally, I have created these R related search queries as well:\nSearch Engine\nKeyword\nQuery URL\nGithub - Language:R\nghr\nhttps://github.com/search?q=%slanguage%3Ar\nGithub Gist - Language:R\ngistr\nhttps://gist.github.com/search?q=%s+language%3Ar&ref=searchresults\nStackOverFlow - Tag:R\nstackoverflowr\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Br%5D+%s\nMETACRAN\nmetacran\nhttps://www.r-pkg.org/search.html?q=%s\nDan Goldstein’s Site\ndanr\nhttp://www.dangoldstein.com/search_r.html?cx=partner-pub-8815643643661420%3Al9jc9v-e2vi&cof=FORID%3A10&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%s&sa=Search&siteurl=www.dangoldstein.com%2Fsearch_r.html&ref=search.r-project.org%2F&ss=265j35153j3\nR Documentation\nrdocs\nhttp://rdocumentation.org/\nR Package Documentation - Packages\nrdrrpkg\nhttps://rdrr.io/find/?repos=cran%2Cbioc%2Crforge%2Cgithub&fuzzy_slug=%s\nRStudio Website\nrstudio\nhttps://rstudio.com/#stq=%s&stp=1\nR-Bloggers\nrbloggers\nhttps://cse.google.com/cse?cx=005359090438081006639%3Apaz69t-s8ua&ie=UTF-8&q=%s&sa=Go\nR Code\nOnline Reference: https://jimbrig.github.io/browsr/reference/search.html\nGeneral Search Engine\n\n\n#' Generalized Search and Search Engine Examples\n#'\n#' Use these functions to search the web directly from your browser,\n#' building advanced queries and supplying common useful R related domains.\n#'\n#' @param s string to search for (`%s` in the query URL)\n#' @param query_url string representing the URL to query;
